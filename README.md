## Reverse an Array
Code Challenge : Class 01

### Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

### Approach & Efficiency
I chose to create an empty array for my result, then reverse-for-loop through the existing array, popping off each index and pushing it into the result array simultaneously.
